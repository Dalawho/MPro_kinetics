# MPro_kinetics

Jupyter notebook to simulate enzymatic activity data in presence of a covalent inhibitor. 
Can be used to compare and test different fitting methods. 
Here, a univariant (local) fit is compared with a multivariant (global) fit of the data. 
This was inspired by discussions with Wal Ward on the COVID Moonshot forum.
Fit equations used are taken from Documents on covalent inhibitor fitting prepared by Wal Ward.
